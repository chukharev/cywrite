# CyWrite 

**Purpose.** CyWrite is a web-based low-feature text editor with built-in keystroke logging, eye tracking, and automated writing evaluation (AWE). The AWE modules are currently being prepared for public release.

**Status.** This is a preliminary minimally viable public release. The codebase is still being packaged to make it usable outside its original deployment at Iowa State University.

**Documentation.** Detailed documentation is forthcoming. At this point, run `npm install && npm start`
